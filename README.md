# LING means Legacy Is Not Good

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ling-framework/orm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ling-framework/orm)

Ling is a minimalistic PHP MVC framework, carefully designed not to make a legacy issue. Inspired by Wordpress, Laravel and usa-framework.

LING ORM is just a thin layer of SQL. It just only provides primitive and minimal function.
